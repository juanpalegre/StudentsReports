## Students Reports Application

Application developed in Java for the Kodigo Academy's Java Developer bootcamp.
The main objective is the development of a clean code that applies the SOLID principles, which is reflected from an application that has the following characteristics:

- The classes are developed in such a way that they fulfill a single responsibility, following the principle of SRP.

- At the same time, considering the open and closed principle, the classes are open for their extension but closed for their modification.

- It is possible to replace the extensions to their base classes, following the Liskov principle.

- Particular use cases have a specific interface, following the principle of interface segregation.

- High level modules do not depend on low level ones, ensuring the principle of dependency inversion.
